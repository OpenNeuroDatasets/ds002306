We measured brain activity using functional MRI while six subjects (“sub-01”, …, “sub-06”) performed 103 cognitive tasks.

The entire folder consists of subject-wise subfolders (“sub-01”,…). Each subject’s folder contains the following subfolders:
1) anat: T1-weighted structural images
2) func: functional signals (multi-band echo-planar images)

Each subject performed 18 runs consisting of 12 training runs and 6 test runs. The training and test data were assigned with the following notations:
 Training data: sub-0*_task-training_run-**_bold.json
 Test data: sub-0*_task-test_run-**_bold.json

Each *_event.tsv file contains following information:
 ONSET: stimulus onset
 DURATION: stimulus duration
 TRIAL_TYPE: task type (out of 103 tasks)

***Caution***
This dataset can be used for research purposes only. The data were anonymised, and users shall not perform analyses to re-identify individual subjects.
